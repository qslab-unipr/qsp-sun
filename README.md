# Quantum State Preparation with $\Lambda$-type Operators

## Description

This repository is dedicated to Sun et al.'s QSP algorithm (arXiv:2108.06150) and its optimizations. The folder denominated **SUN_v1.0.0** contains the first known implementation of the original algorithm in the lower bound of the first parametric range defined by Theorem 1, where the ancillary register grows as $m=2n$, for $n$ input qubits. The folder called **OSUN_v1.0.0** contains the optimized version in the same parametric range, based on a single $\Lambda$-type operator (instead of three of the original version) for each level of Uniformly Controlled Gate (UCG).

Some tests regarding the effectiveness of the SUN algorithm are collected in the folders named, respectively, *qsp_test_results_date* and *single_cases_result_date*.
