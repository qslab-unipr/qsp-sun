# Quantum State Preparation with $\Lambda$-type operators

## Description

This repository is dedicated to Sun et al.'s QSP algorithm (arXiv:2108.06150) and its optimizations. The folder denominated SUN_v1.0.0 contains the implementation of the original version of the algorithm in the first parametric range defined by Theorem 1, where the ancillary register belongs to the interval ($2n$, O($2^n/nlogn$)) for $n$ input qubits. The folder called OSUN_v1.0.0 contains the optimized version in the same parametric range, based on a single $\Lambda$-type operator (instead of three of the original version) for each level of Uniformly Controlled Gate (UCG).
